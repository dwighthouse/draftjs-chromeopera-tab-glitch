<title>Tab Issue in Draft.js</title>

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/draft-js/0.10.1/Draft.css">

<p>Problem case: The latest version of Draft.js (v0.10.1) cannot correctly handle character insertions near a tab character. The data can become visually corrupted and errors are printed to console.</p>

<p>The behavior seen in this problem case is identical to the issue found when using Browserify to build draft.js (and other required libraries) into a browser-compatible bundle. This issue has nothing to do with the standalone nature of these scripts.</p>

<p>All libraries are using the latest available via CDN:</p>

<ul>
    <li>react - v15.6.1</li>
    <li>react-dom - v15.6.1</li>
    <li>immutable.js - v3.8.1</li>
    <li>babel-standalone - v6.26.0</li>
    <li>draft.js - v0.10.1</li>
</ul>

<p>The behavior seen in this problem case has nothing to do with the specific versions of the library used, save for draft.js (see <a href="WorkingCase.html">Working Case</a>).<p>

<p>To reproduce:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Copy the text in the textarea below which contains an explicit tab character.</li>
    <li>Paste the copied text into the Draft.js Editor.</li>
    <li>Move the cursor immediately adjacent to either the left or right of the tab character within the Draft.js Editor.</li>
    <li>Add two or more characters via keyboard.</li>
</ol>

<p>Expected result: The added characters are inserted as normal.</p>
<p>Actual result: A copy of all existing text is inserted one or more times. The copied text may or may not have the added characters. The cursor position moves around incorrectly. As one continues adding characters, eventually an error like <span style="font-family: monospace; background-color: #ddd;">Uncaught DOMException: Failed to execute 'setStart' on 'Range': The offset 22 is larger than the node's length (19).</span> occurs in the console.</p>

<p>The issue was observed happening on Chrome (60) and latest Opera (47). The issue did not occur on Firefox (54.0.1 or 55.0.2), Opera version 45, and Safari (10.1.2). All browsers tested were on Mac OS 10.12.6.</p>
